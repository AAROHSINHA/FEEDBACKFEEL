# 📢 Feedback Feel – Fullstack End-to-End ML Project  

Feedback Feel is a fullstack project built to solve a real pain point I faced in my last two web applications: handling **user feedback** effectively.  

Usually, feedback systems just dump responses into emails or spreadsheets, which gets messy quickly. Instead, Feedback Feel lets you **embed customizable feedback widgets** directly into your application — styled to blend seamlessly with any UI.  

All feedback collected flows into a **dedicated dashboard** that:  
- Filters out **spam vs ham**  
- Runs **sentiment analysis**  
- Highlights **buzzwords & trends**  
- Gives you a clear snapshot of **user sentiment & app performance** in one place

### ⚡ Tech Stack
- **Frontend** → React, Tailwind, TypeScript  
- **Backend** → Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy  
- **Database** → PostgreSQL  
- **ML** → Keras (more to come!)  

---

### 🤖 ML Models Tried So Far
1. Baseline probabilistic ML models  
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)  

---

### 🎯 Next Steps
- Train more advanced RNN models  
- Experiment with **transformers**  
- Leverage **transfer learning** with pre-trained models

### 🧑‍💻 Why This Project?
The main goal was to **solve a real-world problem** while serving as a **learning transporter**.  
This project sparked my journey into **NLP**, helped me dive deeper into **neural networks**, and pushed me to learn **project-based development** in a hands-on way.

✨ *This is just the beginning — Feedback Feel will keep growing alongside my learning journey.*

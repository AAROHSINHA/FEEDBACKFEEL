=> FOR AUTHENTICATION
1. For authentication we are following cookie based authentication. On login, we set the cookie with a session id and
store the session object in sessions table in the db. That session object has an expiry date.
2. The expiry strategy we follow is 'ROLLING EXPIRY'. Means on every successive api call which requires a login check
we see if we update the expiry date, do we get a new one, if we get a new one, we update it. Hence this ensures
the login logout is based on activity rather that a specified time.
3. If the user is logged out, the cookie is deleted. We let the session object stay in the session db. The next time the
same user tries to login again, we would know by his/her dev_id and we simply update the session object.
SIMPLE!
